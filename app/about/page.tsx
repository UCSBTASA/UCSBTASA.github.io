              <p>
                The Taiwanese American Student Association (TASA) at University
                of California, Santa Barbara is a student-led social & cultural
                organization on campus that celebrates and explores everything
                Taiwanese American. We welcome people from all cultural
                backgrounds. Even though we&apos;ve grown and changed much over
                the years, our mission to promote community, friendship, and
                culture amongst the student body has remained the same. We hold
                countless events throughout the school year, such as big &
                little pick up, retreat, night market, and more! We are more
                than just a club -- we strive to be a second home for all our
                members!
